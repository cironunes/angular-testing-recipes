## Boilerplate

Before start we need to initialize the service and mock it's dependencies in our tests:

```js
describe('SampleService', function() {
  'use strict';

  var sampleService;

  beforeEach(module('myApp'));

  beforeEach(inject(function(_sampleService_) {
    sampleService = _sampleService_;
  }));

  ...
});
```

## Public properties

To test public properties, all you need to do is access them directly from the `sampleService`:

> Test:

```js
it('should expose a property', function() {
    expect(sampleService.foo).toBe('bar');
});
```

> Code:

```js
var service = {
  foo: 'bar'
};

return service;
```

## Public methods

To test public methods, all you need to do is call them directly from the `sampleService`:

> Test:

```js
it('should have a method', function() {
    expect(sampleService.foo()).toBe('bar');
});
```

> Code:

```js
var service = {
  foo: function() {
    return 'bar';
  }
};

return service;
```
